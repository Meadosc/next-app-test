# Next App Test

This is a small project I created to test Next.js and Typescript. It calls a public api that feeds some example data.


## Getting Started

Firts, install the node packages:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
